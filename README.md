# Forecasting Weekly Emergency Department Visits for Influenza Using RNNs

This project applies Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) ‚Äî including Simple RNN and LSTM architectures ‚Äî to forecast **weekly influenza-related emergency department (ED) visits in California**.  
The goal is to capture seasonal flu trends, evaluate model accuracy, and support early resource planning for healthcare systems.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Forecast upcoming weekly influenza-related ED visits.  
- Compare the predictive performance of **Simple RNN vs LSTM**.  
- Identify seasonal peaks and evaluate model stability under raw vs smoothed data.

## üß∞ Tech Stack
| Category | Tools / Libraries |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Language** | Python 3.10 +  |
| **Data Handling** | Pandas, NumPy |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| **Modeling** | TensorFlow / Keras |
| **Evaluation** | Scikit-learn (MSE, RMSE, MAE) |

---

## üß™ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Pre-processing**  
   - Parsed and aggregated weekly ED visit data from California Open Data Portal.  
   - Handled missing values, standardized timestamps, and adjusted for Daylight Saving Time.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Examined multi-year trends to confirm strong winter seasonality.  
   - Visualized weekly distributions, correlations, and anomalies.  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Implemented baseline Simple RNN on sine-wave simulation for behavior testing.  
   - Built and tuned LSTM model for forecasting ED visits.  
   - Compared raw vs smoothed (moving-average) input signals to analyze stability.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Measured performance using **MSE, RMSE, and MAE**.  
   - Compared loss curves and prediction alignment against real data.  

5. **Results & Insights**  
   - LSTM outperformed Simple RNN in long-term memory capture.  
   - Smoothed data led to ~12‚Äì15 % lower RMSE and more stable training.  
   - Forecasts align with known CDC influenza surges (Nov‚ÄìFeb).
